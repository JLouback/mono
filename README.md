te thesis

Writing a monograph about the development process and findings of a Computer Vision system to analyze digital images of skin lesions.

The pdf file is the incomplete monograph, detailing the logic behing the algorithm. May be an interesting read.

The procImag directory has some of the processed images I generated to be displayed in the article.
